This is my personal Emacs configuration that I put together over time by collecting from multiple sources.

I try to keep it as simple as possible and to maximize performance.
The configuration core uses:
1. =use-package= for organizing configuration
2. =evil= for VI modal editing style.
3. =straight= for package management.
4. =general= for keybinding settings. 

Some nice commands to know:
1. =use-package-report= shows which package were loaded and configured.
2. =general-describe-keybindings= shows all keybindings defined using =general=.
3. =describe-keymap= shows the keybindings for a keymap.

I appreciate any feedback, feel free to contact me.
